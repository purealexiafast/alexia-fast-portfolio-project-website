# Alexia Fast Portfolio 

Author: Alexia Fast

## Description

The project assignment was to create a portfolio website from scratch that was identical to the mock-up provided but with individualized content. I mostly worked with flex-box and positioning to achieve the desired results. I struggled a bit with flex-box as I was more familiar with positioning elements. I did, however, achieve the desired result for the article images and page layout. The finished portfolio has a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport. 

I learned a lot about opacity and z-index properties. I was able to use these properties to successfully create a border around the images that were 100% opacity, while the image itself was 50% opacity. Also, it was interesting for me to learn how to link a deployed website to an image, as I have only ever linked to text. Overall I found this challenge difficult but achievable.
